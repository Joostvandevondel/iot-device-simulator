# Simple Node Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-web.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-web)

### Info

Simple node server with package.json (for back-end) and bower.json (for front-end) to clone and jumpstart a Javascript project. The setup is MVC. Every file has comments to what its purpose exactly is.

Note: To serve the public directory, Nginx or V8 are better suited than node to do so.

### Use

Clone the project with following command

```
$ git clone https://Temmermans@bitbucket.org/Temmermans/simple-node-server.git
```
cd in the project and install npm and bower dependecies

```
$ npm install && bower install
```
fire up the server by using the following command

```
$ node ./bin/www
```
